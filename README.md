## Projects
#### Probing Blood Dynamics: A Novel Piezoelectric Approach to Monitor Flow and Detect Clot Formation
The paper is currently under review for MDPI Sensors journal publication.

#### No2Pollution: A Guide to Analyze Air Quality via Level-2 Satellite Imagery
Provides a comprehensive guide to analyze emissions using Level-2 satellite imagery & adaptable codebase that extends to regions where resources for advanced monitoring technologies may be limited. 

This [diagram](flow (1).png) shows the flowchart of our analysis 

The [paper](Papers/No2Pollution_EuCNC24.pdf) is currently under review for EuCNC & 6G Summit conference

#### Regional CubeSat Communication and Constellation Design Evaluation
Created a simulator of small satellite constellations that will, in advance of their deployment, serve as a proactive measure to mitigate potential issues and curtail the risk of costly satellite failures.

The [paper](Papers/CubeSat_IEEE ICM2023.pdf) has been published on IEEE Xplore

#### SatNet SpaceSim: A Platform for Performance Analysis of Small Satellites Mega-Constellations
Introduced SatNet SpaceSim, a simulator and a graphical user interface developed to analyze the performance of communication links and coverage of small satellite constellations before deployment. This aims to detect and address potential issues proactively, reducing the risk of costly satellite malfunctions. 

The [paper](Papers/SatNetSpaceSim_EuCNC24.pdf) is currently under review for EuCNC & 6G Summit conference

#### Clot Monitoring Through Electromechanical Analysis
Proposed a novel approach to detect the existence of a blood clot inside a vessel utilizing piezoelectric sensors. The developed model also allows us to determine the vessel radius and the velocity of the blood at different locations.

The [paper](Papers/Clot Monitoring_IEEE ICSC2023.pdf) has been published on IEEE Xplore

#### Non-invasive continuous blood pressure measurement using deep learning
Evaluated 3 deep learning models (WGAN, DCT/FFNN, UNet Architecture) on public datasets (MIMIC & BCG). Investigated practical and innovative tools to continuously monitor blood pressure.
