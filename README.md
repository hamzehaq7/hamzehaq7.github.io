## <span style="color:#004d7a;">Projects</span>

### AirGo: Climate Solutions Startup
We have developed an air quality monitoring prototype with Prof. Khaled Salama.

Currently, we are currently looking to validate the product with potential customers before startup incubation at [Shenzhen InnoX Academy](https://en.innoxsz.com/) in June 2025.

Navigate to our website: [AirGo Website](https://airgo.live)

### Blood Flow Detection Using Piezoelectric Sensors
Proposed a novel approach to detect the existence of a blood clot inside a vessel utilizing piezoelectric sensors.. Conducted experiments around an artificial blood vessel to investigate the behavior of blood velocity & pressure in the presence of a clot.

[Blood Flow Detection Using Piezoelectric Sensors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810278/metrics#metrics) has been published on IEEE Sensors journal.

[Clot Monitoring Through Electromechanical Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449743) has been presented in the 11th IEEE International Conference on Systems and Control (ICSC) in Sousse, Tunisia and published on IEEE Xplore.

### CubeSat Communication 
Created a simulator & GUI to analyze the performance of communication links and coverage of small satellite constellations before deployment. This aims to detect and address potential issues proactively, reducing the risk of costly satellite malfunctions. 

[Regional CubeSat Communication & Constellation Design Evaluation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10378915) has been presented in the 2023 International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM) in Abu Dhabi, UAE and published on IEEE Xplore.

[SatNet SpaceSim: A Platform for Performance Analysis of Small Satellites Mega-Constellations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597066) has been presented in the 2024 EuCNC/6G Summit in Antwerp, Belgium and published on IEEE Xplore.

## <span style="color:#004d7a;">Hackathons & Competitions</span>

### International Business Plan Competition 2025 - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign hosted in Austin, Texas
We founded startup “TagAlong” – system that uses powerbanks to charge EV semi trucks while on the move. Also, we performed a detailed revenue model, cost structure, feasibility study.

### TecShift Hackathon 2024 - Aramco & Lab7, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
We created Solar Synergies - a blockchain platform that allows businesses to trade carbon credits. Also, using the data generated from these transactions, we 
influence government policy decisions in the form of AI-driven insights.

### Student Engineering Gathering - Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman
I presented my senior project and simulator - SatNet SpaceSim. Also, I networked with experts in Oman's tech industry.

### AI in Finance Hackathon - Dept. of Finance, Dubai, UAE
We secured first place and a 10,000 AED grant by envisioning a platform that provides & collects data on microfinancing solutions for locals. Moreover, this platform 
uses AI algorithms to reallocate government budget and expenditure. 

### Youth Sustainability Hackathon - General Electric, Dubai, UAE
We secured third place by solving energy transition challenges tied to UAE’s Zero Net Emissions by 2050. By devising
an energy mix plan, we were able to add 60GW renewable power to UAE’s grid.

### Pioneers 4.0 Hackathon - Lipton Teas & Infusions, Abu Dhabi, UAE
For 3 days, we tried to understand key logistics challenges Lipton faces. To solve this issue, we proposed a metaheuristics model to optimize real-world factory challenge: silos, lines, warehouse.
