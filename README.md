## <span style="color:#004d7a;">Projects</span>

### Probing Blood Dynamics: A Novel Piezoelectric Approach to Monitor Flow and Detect Clot Formation
The paper is currently under review (major revisions) for MDPI Sensors journal publication.

### Regional CubeSat Communication and Constellation Design Evaluation
Created a simulator of small satellite constellations that will, in advance of their deployment, serve as a proactive measure to mitigate potential issues and curtail the risk of costly satellite failures. The [paper](Papers/CubeSat_IEEE%20ICM2023.pdf) has been published on IEEE Xplore.

### SatNet SpaceSim: A Platform for Performance Analysis of Small Satellites Mega-Constellations
Introduced SatNet SpaceSim, a simulator and a graphical user interface developed to analyze the performance of communication links and coverage of small satellite constellations before deployment. This aims to detect and address potential issues proactively, reducing the risk of costly satellite malfunctions. The [paper](Papers/SatNetSpaceSim_EuCNC24.pdf) has been published on IEEE Xplore.

### Clot Monitoring Through Electromechanical Analysis
Proposed a novel approach to detect the existence of a blood clot inside a vessel utilizing piezoelectric sensors. The developed model also allows us to determine the vessel radius and the velocity of the blood at different locations. The [paper](Papers/Clot%20Monitoring_IEEE%20ICSC2023.pdf) has been published on IEEE Xplore.

## <span style="color:#004d7a;">Hackathons & Competitions</span>

### TecShift Hackathon 2024 - Aramco & Lab7, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
We created Solar Synergies - a blockchain platform that allows businesses to trade carbon credits. Also, using the data generated from these transactions, we 
influence government policy decisions in the form of AI-driven insights.

### Student Engineering Gathering - Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman
I presented my senior project and simulator - SatNet SpaceSim. Also, I networked with experts in Oman's tech industry.

### AI in Finance Hackathon - Dept. of Finance, Dubai, UAE
We secured first place and a 10,000 AED grant by envisioning a platform that provides & collects data on microfinancing solutions for locals. Moreover, this platform 
uses AI algorithms to reallocate government budget and expenditure.
